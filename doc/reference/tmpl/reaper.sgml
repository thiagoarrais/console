<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
VteReaper

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
A singleton object which catches %SIGCHLD signals and converts them into
GObject-style &quot;child-exited&quot; signals.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
Because an application may need to be notified when child processes
exit, and because there is only one %SIGCHLD handler, the #VteTerminal
widget relies on a #VteReaper to watch for %SIGCHLD notifications and
retrieve the exit status of child processes which have exited.
