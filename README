* What is Console?

Console is a GTK+ widget implementing terminal-like functionality for
applications without pty interfaces. User input can be received by the app
through a signal and results can be outputted directly. It can also be used
where pty and termcap capabilities are not available.

Most of Console's code was shamelessly copied from VTE. The work here was
basically getting references to pty and termcap removed.

The source code repo and other general directions for console can be found at:

* What is VTE?

VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK+,
and a minimal sample application (vte) using that.  Vte is mainly used in
gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games,
editors, IDEs, etc.

VTE supports Unicode and character set conversion, as well as emulating any
terminal known to the system's terminfo database.

VTE doesn't have a homepage.  Report any issues at:
