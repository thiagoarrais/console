2004-05-02 nalin
	* src/reaper.c(vte_reaper_add_child): pass the global reaper in as
	data when adding the child source, not the terminal which called us.
	Stop accepting a data argument, because we'd discard it anyway.  Return
	the ID of the source which is added, if that happens.
	* configure.in: define VTE_INVALID_SOURCE for internal use.

2004-05-01 nalin
	* README: add pointers to info on bidirectional text and shaping.

2004-05-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_text_maybe_wrapped): add a parameter to
	control whether or not trailing whitespace is trimmed (padraig.obriain,
	#141148).
	* src/vte.c,src/vte.h(vte_terminal_get_text_include_trailing_spaces):
	add as a wrapper for the new vte_terminal_get_text_maybe_wrapped()
	(padraig.obriain, #141148).
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_update_private_d): use
	vte_terminal_get_text_include_trailing_spaces to ensure that we get
	trailing spaces (padraig.obriain, #141148).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): clean up some autowrap stuff.

2004-04-30 nalin
	* vte.pc.in, vte-uninstalled.pc.in: declare the defaultemulation
	variable as one kind of variable, not that other kind (#141515).

2004-04-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_button_release): complete selection if we were
	selecting, not just if Shift is held down (allows Press Shift, Press
	Button, Release Shift, Release Button in addition to already-recognized
	Press Shift, Press Button, Release Button, Release Shift) (#121905).
	* vte.spec: buildrequire gtk-doc, manually copy png images at
	install-time.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c, NEWS, doc/reference/vte-sections.txt,
	doc/reference/tmpl/vte-unused.sgml: documentation updates.
	* doc/reference/tmpl/reaper.sgml: note that we just proxy for glib 2.4
	child_watch functionality, if present.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* python/vte.defs: include get_default_emulation binding.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* vte.spec: update version to 0.11.11

2004-04-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_unrealize): don't unref our accessible peer;
	it may be accessed while we're unrealized, causing it to be destroyed
	and re-created needlessly (#128049).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_finalize): unref our accessible peer.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_finalize): don't clear the child's PID early,
	so that we'll SIGHUP it properly (the kernel should do that anyway,
	but...) (#128291).

2004-04-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): only deselect the current
	selection if just-inserted text affected the selected region of the
	screen (#135259).

2004-04-29 nalin
	* README: assorted updates.
	* configure.in: check for <sys/termios.h>
	* src/pty.c: include <sys/termios.h> if found (#141392).
	* src/dumpkeys.c, src/mev.c, src/pty.c, src/ssfe.c, src/vte.c: do the
	same.
	* doc/reference/vte-sections.txt: add several functions which are new
	but which weren't in the generated docs.
	* doc/reference/vte-unused.txt: sort.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_scroll_region): remove stray debug printfs.

2004-04-29 nalin
	* configure.in: add a --with-default-emulation argument (part of
	#115750).  Use AS_HELP_STRING wherever we need help strings.
	* vte.pc.in, vte-uninstalled.pc.in: add DefaultEmulation variable
	* vte.spec: specify "xterm" as the default-emulation, even though it's
	the default default
	* termcaps/Makefile.am: build and install the default emulation's
	termcap, assuming it's some kind of xterm variant.
	* src/keymap.c(_vte_keymap_map): check for xterm-xfree86 definitions
	if the terminal type includes xterm, not if it exactly matches xterm
	* src/reaper.c(vte_reaper_add_child): add.  The glib 2.4 SIGCHLD
	watcher requires us to register particular PIDs for monitoring, so now
	we require applications to do so.
	* src/reaper.c(vte_reaper_child_watch_cb): add.
	* src/reaper.c(vte_reaper_init): Don't hook the SIGCHLD handler if
	we're running under glib 2.4, expect to use the g_child_watch
	mechanism.
	* src/vte.c: remove hard-coded definition of VTE_DEFAULT_EMULATION,
	to be picked up from config.h instead.
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_cs): remove stray debug printfs.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): only do what we were doing for
	xn if LP was also set (#141445).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_default_emulation): add.
	* src/vte.c(_vte_terminal_fork_basic): call vte_reaper_add_child for
	new children.

2004-04-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_fork_command): more clearly document what
	the argv and envv arguments are expected to contain (#127979).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): attempt to more closely match
	the behavior of am and xn on terminals -- if am is set {if xn is set,
	autowrap should only happen before a character is output, and then only
	if it's a graphic character, otherwise we autowrap after a character is
	output}

2004-04-21 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_text_range_maybe_wrapped): also trim back
	lines which are nothing but whitespace (#140765).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_configure_toplevel): invalidate the whole
	window if we're "transparent", because we don't get expose events
	unless some portion of our area came out from behind something else,
	but we still need to repaint it (#122243).

2004-04-20 nalin
	* doc/reference/tmpl/reaper.sgml: document the child-exited signal.
	* doc/reference/tmpl/vte.sgml: document the emulation-changed and
	encoding-changed signals.

2004-04-20 nalin

	* vte-uninstalled.pc.in: add (Gman, #136129)

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_key_press): don't steal keys from the input
	method.

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/pty.c(_vte_pty_set_utf8): toggle the IUTF8 flag, if
	it was defined at compile-time (maybe for #129317).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_encoding): call _vte_pty_set_utf8.
	* src/vte.h (vte_terminal_anti_alias_get_type): declare.
	* src/vtebg.c(vte_bg_get_pixmap): Optimisation to fix the ridiculous
	amount of time required to render solid colour or extremely small
	image tiled backgrounds.  This fixes bug #123903.  (desrt)
	* src/vtebg.c(vte_bg_root_pixmap): move resize code into a separate
	function.
	* src/vtebg.c(vte_bg_get_pixmap): Resize all image sources, in case
	we're using a very small image file for the background.

2004-04-19 nalin
	* python/Makefile.am: move python module to site-packages/gtk-2.0,
	which is added to the search path only by pygtk 2 (#92252).

2004-04-19 nalin
	* python/vte.override: define a modulename override so that the
	Terminal class is registered in the proper namespace so that python's
	help() builtin sees the Terminal class (#130267).

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_anti_alias_get_type): add, for the sake of
	bindings.

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_key_press): call GtkWidget's key_press_event
	callback for keys, in case GtkWidget has pre-programmed behavior for
	that key (#133878).
	* configure.in, gnome-pty-helper/configure.in: quote names of defined
	functions (#133222).
	* configure.in: make compilation of gnome-pty-helper actually
	conditional (#133077).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_process_incoming): Doh #132610, actually
	call vte_terminal_emit_contents_changed() when the contents change.

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/vte.h, src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_font_full): Add (#134429).
	* src/vteglyph.c(_vte_glyph_cache_set_font_description): take a
	VteTerminalAntiAlias argument.
	* src/vteft2.c, src/vtegl.c, src/pango.c, src/pango.x, src/vtexft.c
	(*_set_text_font): take a VteTerminalAntiAlias argument.

	* src/vte.h src/vte.c: Added default signal handlers to
	VteTerminalClass (#137961).  [NOTE: ABI change.]

2004-04-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_configure_toplevel): don't re-invalidate
	everything, apparently unnecessary (#122243).  Might need to back this
	out if I ever remember what specific combination of software and
	versions prompted its addition in the first place.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_class_init): tell gettext that messages
	retrieved from this domain should be returned in UTF-8 (#139542).

2004-04-19 nalin
	* configure.in: don't disable use of deprecated APIs unless asked
	to do so.
	* src/keymap.c(_vte_keymap_GDK_space): add Meta case (gafton).
	* src/vtefc.c(_vte_fc_width_from_pango_stretch): add.
	* src/vtefc.c(_vte_fc_transcribe_from_pango_font_description): handle
	PangoStretch characteristics using _vte_fc_width_from_pango_stretch.
	* src/vteregex.c: add random comments.
	* src/vte.c(VteTerminal): track the "xn" terminal attribute.

2003-09-15 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c: add options for exercising the cursor and highlight
	colors.
	* src/debug.c: flush output streams when we check if debugging is
	enabled, because we'll probably output a string next.
	* src/iso2022.c: don't print a zero-length string.  Yay compiler
	warnings.
	* src/interpret.c: use g_print() instead of fprintf() to print.
	* src/keymap.c,src/ssfe.c: include <stdarg.h>, hopefully fixing
	bug #121880 (or not).

2003-09-15 nalin
	* python/vte.defs: add specs for set_color_cursor and
	set_color_highlight.

2003-09-15 nalin
	* src/vte.h,src/vte.c: add vte_terminal_set_color_cursor.
	* src/vte.h,src/vte.c: add vte_terminal_set_color_highlight (#69776).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_determine_colors): add parameters for
	specifying if the cell being rendered is the cursor or is highlighted,
	probably for being selected.  If either flag is set, and we've been
	given a color to use for the purpose by a caller, use the supplied
	color, else use inverse colors.

2003-09-15 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c(process_control): don't reset the conversion state
	when we hit an end-of-line.  I wasn't reading RFC1468 closely enough,
	as it states that each line begins in the same encoding as the end of
	the previous line, and read "application should reset before end-of-
	line" as "terminal resets at end-of-line" (bug #122156).

2003-09-11 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c: silence a compiler warning.

2003-09-11 nalin
	* README: ask for LC_* in addition to LANG if weird spacing errors
	crop up.
	* src/vteconv.c,src/vteconv.h: add wrappers for _vte_conv which weed
	out some warnings.
	* src/iso2022.c: use _vte_conv_cu instead of _vte_conv.
	* src/trie.c: use _vte_conv_cu instead of _vte_conv.
	* src/vte.c: give _vte_terminal_fudge_pango_colors a return type again.
	* src/vtebg.c: ifdef out vte_bg_source_name, which is unused.
	* src/vtebg.c,src/vterdb.c: wrap calls to gdk_property_get to weed out
	some compiler warnings.

2003-09-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_cells_with_attributes): properly resolve
	colors and cell properties to drawing colors.
	* src/vte.c(_vte_terminal_fudge_pango_colors): add a function for
	mapping GTK+ white-on-black preedit text to default reverse-colored
	text for the terminal.
	* src/vte.c(_vte_terminal_translate_pango_cells): don't bother
	doing anything with the attribute for a range if the list is NULL.
	Fudge white-on-black text to default colors in reverse so that it
	works when the terminal is in a black-on-white color scheme.

2003-09-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c(_vte_terminal_apply_pango_attr): map weight attributes to
	the terminal's bold attribute.

2003-09-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c(_vte_terminal_map_pango_color): add.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_im_preedit_changed): don't discard the
	attributes list for the preedit string -- save them.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_cells_with_attributes): add.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint): use draw_cells_with_attributes to
	use the preedit attributes list when drawing the preedit string.  This
	changes the way the preedit string is presented to the user, but it
	now looks [more] like GTK+ suggests it should look, so it should be a
	good change.

2003-08-13 nalin
	* src/caps.c: add sequences for linux-console-cursor-attributes, which
	we'll ignore (bug #108232).

2003-08-13 nalin
	* configure.in: if we don't find the python headers (even if we found
	python), disable compilation of python bindings (bug #116756).  Make the
	checks for python support sequential for easier maintenance.
	* python/vte.defs: add def for vte_terminal_match_set_cursor_type.  Make
	the color argument to vte_terminal_set_background_tint_color const.
	* python/vte.override(_wrap_vte_terminal_forkpty): add.
	* python/vte.override(_wrap_vte_terminal_fork_command): don't leak envv.

2003-08-13 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_fork_command,vte_terminal_forkpty): doc update
	to note that directory and envv can be NULL for both.

2003-08-13 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c(main): if -S is passed, use forkpty to start a child that
	just counts until killed with Ctrl-C.

2003-08-13 nalin
	* doc/reference/vte-sections.txt: add vte_terminal_forkpty.
	* src/pty.c(_vte_pty_run_on_pty): exit on any error, to avoid leaving
	random unreaped children running.  Accept NULL command indicating that
	no exec() should occur, but still error out if command isn't NULL and
	exec() fails.
	* src/pty.c(_vte_pty_fork_on_pty_name,_vte_pty_fork_on_pty_fd): store
	0 as the new child's PID if we're the child.
	* src/pty.c(main): don't run "tty" by default, test the forkpty() case
	instead.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_fork_command): rename to
	_vte_terminal_fork_basic.  Remove code to replace NULL command with
	the user's shell.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_fork_command): new! wrap
	_vte_terminal_fork_basic, replacing a NULL command with the user's
	shell.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_forkpty),src/vte.h: new! wrap
	_vte_terminal_fork_basic, passing NULL for the command and argv
	arguments (bug #116450).
	* src/Makefile.am: update shared library version.

2003-08-12 nalin
	* configure.in: if <ft2build.h> isn't found, then we can't use any
	freetype-specific bits, and that's not useful.  Error out, and say
	that we need freetype 2.0.2 or newer, which introduced this header
	into the procedure (bug #116341).

2003-08-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: don't create an accessible peer at init() time in
	debug mode.
	* gnome-pty-helper/gnome-pty-helper.c(struct pty_info): add a field to
	keep track of whether or not we created a lastlog record.
	* gnome-pty-helper/gnome-pty-helper.c(shutdown_pty): also try to
	write a logout record if pi->lastlog is true, because in doing so we
	free pi->data, closing a leak (bug #116091).

2003-08-12 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c(resize_window): don't add the padding in when calculating
	the new window size.

2003-08-12 nalin
	* doc/reference/tmpl/vte.sgml: note that dimensions passed in with
	the resize-window signal include padding (more of bug #119141).

2003-08-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_character_attributes,
	vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal): remove redundant type checks.
	* src/vte.c(all signal handlers): return a boolean indicating whether
	or not to exit the processing loop instance early to allow the
	application to deal with some input (usually along the lines of a
	signal requesting that the terminal be resized) (bug #118938).

2003-08-12 nalin
	* python/vte.override(get_text,get_text_range): reorder arguments to
	match the order for the C versions (#118882).
	* python/vte.override(get_text,get_text_range,call_callback): fix
	refcounting and callback argument marshalling (bug #118882).
	* python/vte-demo.py: exercise get_text() on "window-raise" signals.

2003-08-12  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* src/vteaccess.c:
	(vte_terminal_initialize): New function containing initialization code
	previously in vte_terminal_accessible_new. Also set role in
	this function.
	(vte_terminal_accessible_class_init): Specify function pointer for
	vte_terminal_initialize.
	(vte_terminal_accessible_get_type): Do not set instance data size or
	GInstanceInitFunc. Remove vte_terminal_accessible_init.

	This fixes bug #119694.

2003-08-11 nalin
	* python/vte.override: add binding for get_padding() (bug #118834).

2003-08-11 nalin
	* python/vte.override: add binding for get_cursor_position()
	(bug #118800).

2003-08-11 nalin
	* python/vte.defs: give length parameters for feed() and feed_child()
	default values of -1 (bug #118711).
	* python/vte.override: use the length parameter if it's supplied to the
	feed() and feed_child() methods.

2003-08-11 nalin
	* python/vte.override: add overrides for feed() and feed_child()
	methods which use the length of the string as given in C, to hopefully
	allow passing NUL bytes around as part of strings (bug #118711).  Make
	the length parameter optional, and ignored, to try to avoid breaking
	existing Python code in an obvious way.

2003-08-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_start_selection,vte_terminal_extend_selection):
	drop an unnecessary cast-and-check, which we don't need because we have
	no use for the GtkWidget pointer to the terminal.  Fix initial shift-
	click (bug #118106).

2003-08-11 nalin
	* configure.in: error out if we don't find ncurses, curses, or
	libtermcap development headers (bug #117754).

2003-08-11 nalin
	* autogen.sh: export WANT_AUTOCONF_2_5 for the sake of Mandrake autoconf
	wrapper (bug #119066).

2003-08-05 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal,
	vte_sequence_handler_window_manipulation): include the widget's padding
	widths in resize requests (bug #119141).

2003-07-30 nalin
	* autogen.sh: check for autoconf-2.51, autoconf-2.50, autoconf-2.5 when
	looking for autoconf 2.5x (bug #118627).

2003-07-21 nalin
	* gnome-pty-helper/configure.in: define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED,
	_XOPEN_SOURCE, and __EXTENSIONS__ for Solaris, as we do in the top-level
	configure (#117636).

2003-07-16 nalin
	* gnome-pty-helper/configure.in: check for grantpt in libc and then
	in libpt.  Check for openpty in libc before checking libutil.  Check for
	sendmsg in libc before checking libsocket (with libnsl) (#117636).

2003-07-11  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>
	* configure.in: Added Walloon (wa) to ALL_LINGUAS

	empty string in response to the ENQ control sequence instead of "xterm".
	Report and patch from Mariano Suárez-Alvarez (#116495).

	from Roger So.
	* src/dumpkeys.c, src/iso2022.c, src/iso8859mode.c, src/nativeecho.c,
	src/utf8echo.c, src/utf8mode.c, src/vte.c: don't use the literal escape
	character, express it as an octal sequence.

2003-06-16 nalin
	* src/caps.c: add vertical-tab and form-feed to the list of control
	sequences.
	* src/vte.c(vte_controL_sequence_handler_form_feed): add.

	* src/vtedraw.c, src/vtedraw.h: add get_char_width(), for use in drawing
	the cursor.
	* src/vte.c(vte_invalidate_cursor_once): if the character under the
	cursor doesn't fit into its cell, expose the column to the right of
	it so that we can paint into the adjacent cell.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint): when clearing the area behind the
	cursor or drawing the hollow rectangle to indicate its position when
	we don't have focus, use the visible width of the character instead
	of just assuming it will fit.  This complies better with assertion 2.

2003-06-09 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_encoding): set the encoding for the iso2022
	converter (spotted by havill).

2003-06-04 nalin

	more context.
	* src/iso2022.c(_vte_iso2022_ambiguous_width): add for using the
	current encoding to determine what the width of an ambiguously-wide
	character should be.  This seems to work better.

2003-05-30  Padraig O'Briain  <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	back compat with 0.10.x.
	* src/iso2022.c(_vte_iso2022_sequence_length): don't recognize PM
	messages -- Xterm doesn't do anything with them and we don't want to
	appear to hang when we're really just waiting for the end of the
	message.

2003-05-28 nalin

	crude approximations of characters when we have a font for them.

2003-05-21 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_scroll_region): force an entire window repaint
	if we're supposed to scroll the background but we're not scrolling the
	entire window.  This means we need to repaint the scrolled region, and
	to keep things looking right, we need to repaint everything.
	* src/vteapp.c(main): enable visible bell if we're disabling the
	audible bell, and vice-versa.
	* src/vte.c: flesh out some doc comments.

2003-05-21 nalin
	* src/interpret.c: use _vte_matcher_free_params_array.
	* src/vte.c(vte_invalidate_cursor_once): add a parameter for indicating
	if this is a "cursor blink" (periodic) refresh, and if it is set and

	* src/interpret.c, src/table.c, src/trie.c: use
	_vte_matcher_free_params_array to free parameter arrays instead of

	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_set_title_internal): only attempt to
	close the conversion descriptor if it was opened successfully.
	* src/vteapp.c: add the -k option to spin after gtk_main() returns.

	* gnome-pty-helper/gnome-utmp.c: only include <utmp.h> if HAVE_UTMP_H
	was defined (#111925).
	* src/keymap.c, src/ssfe.c: unconditionally include <term.h> if we
	defined HAVE_CURSES or HAVE_NCURSES, as having the header is a
	precondition for defining either (#111925).
	* src/iso2022.c: make each array have at least one element (#111925).
	* src/pty.c, src/gnome-login-support.c: try to open /dev/ptc if opening

	for a child to exit.
	* po/POTFILES.in: add more source files for scanning.
	* src/iso2022.c: rework pieces to handle incomplete sequences at the

	it isn't used.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint): don't look at drawing starting at

	* src/vtegl.c: prefer glX double-buffering to GDK's, and use double-
	buffered possibly-direct windows instead of indirect pixmaps.

2003-05-12 nalin
	* src/vtebg.c(_vte_bg_get_pixmap, _vte_bg_get_pixbuf): account for the

	* src/vtedraw.c: only use pangox, xft if X_DISPLAY_MISSING is not
	defined.
	* src/vtedraw.c, src/vtedraw.h: add get_using_fontconfig() method.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_using_xft): use
	_vte_draw_get_using_fontconfig(), which is what apps really want to
	know when they call this function.
	* src/vtegl.c: wrap in #ifndef X_DISPLAY_MISSING.
	* src/vtepangox.c: wrap in #ifndef X_DISPLAY_MISSING.
	* src/vtexft.c: wrap in #ifndef X_DISPLAY_MISSING.

	* src/vtedraw.c, src/vtedraw.h: add get_visual and get_colormap
	methods so that drawing methods can override the default visual and
	colormap.  Rename get_text_base() to get_text_ascent(), which is more
	correct.  Remove scroll(), which would just wrap gdk_window_scroll().
	* src/vte.c: fix logic for choosing alternate render methods when
	VTE_USE_XFT is "0".
	* src/vteapp.c: add -- option to stop parsing options with getopt.

	silly to try to force the cursor to be drawn when we're not realized,
	either.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_background_update): disconnect self, just in
	case we were called directly while still queued, which would otherwise
	leak the source, leading to potential problems later (Red Hat #84368).

2003-02-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_scroll_window): use gdk_window_scroll if the

	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_row): skip over fragments properly.
	* src/vte.c(vte_unichar_width): rework in terms of the width checking

	accessible peer instead of a static pointer (part of #104909).
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_finalize): if the accessible peer still exists,
	remove its weak pointer before attempting to unref it.

	more accurately reflects its purpose.
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_update_private_data_if_needed):
	always update the cursor position, in case text was added or removed
	without the cursor itself moving.
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_get_text_somewhere): don't

	a weak pointer (part of #104909).
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_finalize): if the terminal
	peer is not NULL, disconnect it as a weak pointer and don't bother
	disconnecting from its signals (part of #104909).  Add a debug message.
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_text_finalize):  Add a debug
	message.

	nothing.

2003-01-27 nalin	
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_decset_internal): make the various mouse event
	modes mutually-exclusive, because apps expect them to be (#104395).
	* src/vte.c: add a prototype for vte_terminal_background_update before
	it is used to silence a compiler warning.

2003-01-27 nalin	
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_realize): force a background update immediately

2003-01-20 nalin
	* src/reflect.c: account for atk_text_get_text() being 0-clean.

2003-01-20 nalin
	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/reflect.c: try to build reflect
	with both vte and libzvt, building a useless binary if libzvt isn't
	available.

2003-01-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: colors 90-97 and 100-107 are bold colors, noted and patched

	* configure.in: Added "hu" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-01-17 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_size): emit a "text-modified" signal,
	because what you see changes when you resize the terminal.

2003-01-17 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint): don't draw cursors below or above the
	screen, correctly compute the clear area when drawing the cursor,
	if we're ignoring padding in general because we're monospaced, also
	ignore it when drawing the character under the cursor.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_io_read): eliminate dead code.

2003-01-17 nalin
	* src/keymap.c(_vte_keymap_map): if we don't find an entry for the

	width != 1 when computing runs.

2003-01-17 nalin

	using termcap

2003-01-16 nalin

	pygtk-2.0 isn't found (#103676)

2003-01-14 nalin
	* src/keymap.c(_vte_keymap_key_add_key_modifiers): if a key sequence
	which needs modifiers doesn't have a numeric part, add "1" as the
	numeric part before adding the modifiers.  Spotted by msw.

2003-01-13 nalin
	* src/ring.c, src/ring.h: add _vte_ring_insert_preserve(), which
	scrolls lost items off the top instead of the bottom, as
	_vte_ring_insert() does.
	* src/slowcat.c (catfile): check that we didn't read an EOF before
	attempting to write it.  Skip the more complicated checks and just
	check that the file pointer isn't stdin before closing it.
	* src/ssfe.c: cleanups.
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_sf): add lines to the scrollback area
	when scrolling is restricted but the top line of the area is the
	topmost visible line (Red Hat #75900).

2003-01-13 nalin
	* src/nativeecho.c, src/utf8echo.c: don't switch terminal modes before
	or after echoing bytes -- doing so confuses me now.
	* src/vte.c: make use of '?' to mark invalid data a compile-time define.
	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_text_scrolled): properly
	handle scrolling events with delta less than the window size (more

	* src/vteaccess.c(vte_terminal_accessible_finalize): disconnect
	from text-inserted, text-deleted, text-modified, text-scrolled,
	cursor-moved, window-title-changed on finalize.

	vte_terminal_button_press,vte_terminal_button_release,
	vte_terminal_motion_notify,vte_terminal_focus_in,vte_terminal_focus_out,
	vte_terminal_scroll): track event modifiers in an object-local modifier
	variable.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_key_press): always steal key events from the
	input method if the meta key is down (#96006).  Don't munge the cursor
	or keypad modes before passing them to the keymapping routines.  Stop
	overriding the cursor mode on NumLock (doesn't appear to work as
	documented in other terminals, needed to modify the keymap mode anyway
	(#96364)).
	* configure.in: define HAVE_XFT whenever HAVE_XFT2 is defined -- they're
	more or less compatible (#103130).

	from Brian Cameron.

2003-01-09  nalin
	* src/vte.c: don't just skip reading data if selection is in progress --
	we wedge if we do that (#101739).  Instead, temporarily stop reading
	from the child pty.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_open_font_xft): if we get NULL when matching
	fonts, use the desired pattern's name when displaying an error,
	preventing a NULL dereference (#96769).
	* configure.in: make building of python modules depend on configure
	having been run with --enable-python. make --enable-python the default.
	Fix an indentation error in the version check which chokes Python 2.2.2.
	* src/vte.h, src/vte.c: add new signals to VteTerminalClass (NOTE: may
	break ABI, so might as well add some padding)
	* src/vteaccess.c: be more precise about locations in text_changed
	signals (part of #95901)
	* src/vte.c: get more selective about when we consider it necessary to

	instead of a mess of floating point math when desaturating images.

2003-01-06  nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_init): Add the periodic blinking refresh
	with the normal timeout instead of 0 to avoid wedging when we get
	created without focus.  Fix suggested by Dennis Haney (#102701).

2003-01-06  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Use a simple XftPatternGetString/GetDouble pair instead
	of XftNameUnparse, which isn't in older versions of Xft (#101142).
	* src/vte.c: Add a flag to VteTerminalPrivate which we can use to keep
	track of modifications, particularly if they remove text, and toggle
	it in several sequence handlers.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_process_incoming): Also emit the "contents
	changed" signal when the modified flag is TRUE, not enough to fix
	#95901, but at least making some forward progress.

2003-01-05  Pauli Virtanen <pauli.virtanen@hut.fi>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "fi" (Finnish).

2003-01-04  Stanislav Visnovsky  <visnovsky@nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

	* vte.pc.in: include other libraries (ncurses, termcap, socket,
	whatever) in the list of libraries.
	* src/keymap.c(_vte_keymap_map): for Home and End, consult libncurses
	or libtermcap if we have no hard-wired mapping and there's none in the
	termcap file.  Should fix #100472, even in cases where Home and End
	vary wildly from what I've got on my box.
	* src/keymap.c: rename cursor/fkey_normal to cursor/fkey_default,
	which makes a little more sense.

2003-01-02  Zbigniew Chyla  <cyba@gnome.pl>

	mapping table when mapping line-drawing charset data, simplifies	
	maintenance of the mapping.

	* configure.in: Added Catalan (ca), Spanish (es)
	and Hebrew (he) to ALL_LINGUAS

2002-12-11  nalin

	is enabled at compile-time (enabled by default).
	* src/iso2022.c(_vte_iso2022_substitute): force characters received in
	the line-drawing map to have width = 1 (more #99603), so that we can
	distinguish them from line-drawing characters received in eucXX, which
	have width = 2.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): when mapping from line-drawing
	to gunichars, force a width of 1.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_process_incoming): extend the bounding box
	for updates one cell further to the right, in case the cursor is in
	a cell which contains a wide character.
	* src/pty.c(_vte_pty_start_helper): spit out a warning if the helper
	isn't installed.
	* src/pty.c: don't compile in any gnome-pty-helper-specific code if
	VTE_USE_GNOME_PTY_HELPER isn't defined.

2002-12-10  nalin
	* src/buffer.c, src/buffer.h: centralize buffer length sanity checks,
	add some utility functions for stuffing things into buffers and pulling
	them back out.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: add a lifecycle debug class, for tracking
	down initialization order weirdness.
	* src/pty.c: try to check that we can run the pty helper before
	trying to run it, to avoid SIGPIPE failures when it's not installed.
	* src/vte.c: never grab focus -- let the shell app deal with it.
	Return TRUE from mouse motion and press/release events to keep them
	from being passed up. (#101089)

2002-12-09  nalin
	* configure.in: add "uk" to the list of languages.
	* src/vte.h: remove the alternate attribute bit -- it's no longer
	meaningful.
	* python/vte.override: remove the alternate attribute, add the
	strikethrough attribute.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_insert_char): perform drawing character set
	to Unicode mapping at insertion time if the alternate attribute is set,
	otherwise discarding the attribute.  If the character being inserted is
	a graphic character, force its width to 1 or 2 depending on the current
	codeset (#99603).
	* src/vte.c (xlfd_from_pango_font_description): take advantage of
	XftXlfdParse if we were built with Xft, as it appears to handle family
	aliases.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_draw_graphic): decide what to draw using
	Unicode code points (instead of reverse mappings to drawing set), and
	implement the double-thick versions of many of the existing glyphs.
	Return a boolean indicating whether or not we drew something.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_draw_row): if vte_terminal_draw_graphic()
	returns FALSE, try to draw the graphic character using the current font.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_paint): if vte_terminal_draw_graphic()
	returns FALSE, try to draw the graphic character using the current font.
	* src/caps.c: add the undocumented default 0 to the OSC set text
	parameters sequence (#100468).

2002-12-03  nalin
	* README: updates.
	* src/iso2022.c, src/iso2022.h: add a width mask for overriding widths
	for ambiguous Unicode characters, and _vte_iso2022_get_width() for
	reading the width, using unused bits in Unicode in a manner similar to
	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/iso2022-wc.html
	* src/table.c,src/trie.c: strip out iso2022 widths when extracting
	parameters of control sequences.
	* src/vte.c: heed iso2022 widths when inserting characters into the
	screen buffer, but clear then before storing them so that copy and
	paste will continue to work.
	* src/matcher.c, src/matcher.h: add matcher, a wrapper for table and
	trie, and move _vte_table_narrow_encoding and _vte_table_wide_encoding
	to this module.

2002-12-03  nalin
	* src/pty.c: if TIOCSCTTY is defined, use it, even if it's redundant.

2002-12-02  nalin
	* po: update-po
	* src/utf8echo.c: change the default from resetting to the terminal's
	default encoding before exiting to leaving it alone.  Don't mess with
	the terminal's encoding if stdout isn't connected to a terminal.
	* src/nativeecho.c: add, for printing random bytes.

2002-12-02  nalin
	* src/vte.c: don't zero-fill rows, space-fill them.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_is_word_char): Don't just fail if the
	word_chars array doesn't exist.

2002-12-02  nalin
	* acinclude.m4: add AC_CHECK_CC_OPT from ac-archive.
	* configure.in: check for cfmakeraw, sys/select.h, compiler support
	for -std= (#99698)
	* doc/boxes.txt: change reference to online Docbook reference to the
	charts at the Unicode web site.
	* src/dumpkeys.c: make a best-effort at making a terminal raw on systems
	where cfmakeraw() isn't available, from patch by Brian Cameron.  Wait
	for up to 1/50 of a second for more bytes we'll consider to be part of
	a sequence.
	* src/pty.c(getpt): ensure that the new terminal is opened in non-
	blocking mode.
	* src/trie.c: use g_unichar_digit_value() instead of subtracting '0'.
	* src/vte.c: don't declare the xft_textitem member on non-Xft2 systems,
	because it uses an Xft2-specific type (#99685).
	* src/vteapp.c: add $pkgdatadir/fonts to the font path for testing.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: fix mapping of Unicode code chars 0x252c and 0x2534 which
	incorrectly mixed them up (#99474).
	* src/iso2022.c: fix mapping of 'v' and 'w' from special graphics to
        Unicode, which masked the above bug.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: fix cd() to clear using the current colors.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* termcaps/xterm: add ta back in -- it's not a key sequence.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: fix cd() to clear to the right of the cursor on the current
	line instead of the entire line (#98844).

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: add keyboard debug messages when we change keyboard modes.
	* termcaps/xterm: remove kh definition.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/keymap.c: make keypad arrow keys follow cursor mode (#98604).

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/keymap.c: sort out when we add modifiers to keys (#98094).  Fix
	Alt+Tab.
	* termcaps/xterm: remove ta definition.

2002-11-25  nalin
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: add keyboard debugging class.
	* src/dumpkeys.c: refresh on Ctrl-L, reset on 'r'.
	* src/keymap.c, src/keymap.h: add more setting combinations, and a
	simplistic check for more complete coverage.
	* src/vte.c: add debug messages for keyboard handling.  Improve
	detection of invalid coordinates as a signal that no text is selected
	or hilited (#98946).
	* termcaps/xterm.baseline: add a baseline copy of xterm from my termcap,
	so that I can diff it more easily.
	* termcaps/xterm: remove key definitions -- xterm's way more complicated
	than the capability strings suggest.
	
2002-11-22  nalin
	* configure.in: incorporate more correct check for the right version of
	gtk-doc (#99314).

2002-11-15  Hasbullah BIn Pit <sebol@ikhlas.com>

        * configure.in: Added "ms" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2002-11-11  nalin
	* src/vte.c: ensure that when we select by line, we include all of the
	last line, even if it's past the edge of the screen.  Snap selection to
	the beginning or end of a line when selecting lines which don't exist.
	Only strip off whitespace if there's nothing but whitespace to the right
	of the selection.  Chuck the non-wrapping selection code.

2002-11-11  nalin
	* src/vte.c: properly set the "selecting" flag again when we start
	selection (#97923).

2002-11-11  nalin
	* src/vte.c: rework selection so that word- and line-based selection
	can wrap like XTerm does (#97057,#97719).

2002-11-07  nalin
	* src/vte.h: doc fixes.
	* src/dumpkeys.c: use the older alternate-screen decset value.
	* src/vte.c: fixup screwups on extending selection (#97118).

2002-11-05  nalin
	* src/vte.c: handle end-of-line selection correctly.  Stop highlighting
	selection on click, but don't lose it until new text is selected
	(#97117).
	* python/vte.override: fix binding for set_colors() to properly take a
	list of colors for the palette (#97682).
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: add increase-font-size and decrease-font-size
	to allow mimicking XTerm's behavior on Shift/Control+KP_Add/KP_Subtract
	* src/vteapp.c: handle increase-font-size and decrease-font-size.

2002-11-05  Abi Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>
	* src/vte.c: Add and implement the strikethrough attribute.
	Change underline to be drawn using the ascent, rather than
	arbritarily putting it two lines above the bottom of the
 	charcell - looks much better with large fonts.

2002-11-04  nalin
	* NEWS: be more verbose.
	* README: add more items to the TODO list so that I don't forget them.
	* src/vte.c: ifdef out some of the selection code.

2002-10-30  nalin
	* src/buffer.c, src/iso2022.c, src/vteaccess.c: add ident tags.
	* src/vte.c: don't scroll-to-bottom if we're selecting (#97923).

2002-10-30  nalin
	* src/vteapp.c: implement iconify, deiconify, raise, lower, maximize,
	restore, refresh, resize, and move signals.
	* src/vte.c: add vte_terminal_match_remove().
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_cb): clear the current column in
	addition to columns to the left, spotted by Sam Varshavchik.
	* src/vte.c:  Use g_array_set_size() to clear arrays instead of
	removing each element.  Properly initialize new columns with just the
	default colors and not other attributes (#96978).
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_ta): revert to non-overwriting tabs,
	otherwise we got occasional drawing artifacts.

2002-10-30  Abi Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h : Support dim (halfbright) colours. All the
	infrastructure for this was here already (apart from making sure bold
	and half are mutually exclusive).  Add API set_color_dim, and let
	set_colors take a palette of size 24.

2002-10-29  Abi Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>
	* src/iso2022.c (_vte_iso2022_map_[J4]): Map to UCS, not keysyms.
	(which differ > 0xff).

2002-10-28  Abi Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>
	* src/vte.c: Add line-drawing representation for full block. Draw 
	U+23BA-23BD. Fix drawing of U+23BD (scan line 9) and U+2592 
	(checkerboard) to use bottom line of the charcell, not the top line of 
	the one below.
	* src/iso2022.c: Complete DEC Special Graphics to Unicode map.

2002-10-25  nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_match_check_internal): snip off final
	newlines when we're matching, they're usually not wanted.

2002-10-24  nalin
	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h: replace the simpler pty_open() function with
	a logging version, adding the ability to specify a startup directory
	(Red Hat #76529).
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: replace the simpler fork_command() function with
	a logging version, adding the ability to specify a startup directory
	(Red Hat #76529).
	* src/vteapp.c: modify call to handle new fork_command().
	* python/vte.defs: update as above.
	* python/vte.override: modify call to handle new fork_command(), adding
	an optional "directory" argument.

2002-10-23  nalin
	* src/vte.c: refactor the selection code, cleaning up when selection is
	cleared/started/extended (#95783).

2002-10-22  nalin
	* src/vte.c: rework how wide characters are stored to allow storing
	tabs (#95958).

2002-10-21  nalin
	* python/vte.override: wrap vte_terminal_get_text() and
	vte_terminal_get_text_range().  Based on patch from ha shao (#96230).

2002-10-21  nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: add a user pointer argument to get_text
	callbacks (#96230).
	* src/Makefile.am: bump shared library version because we changed
	a public function's signature.  Take the opportunity to replace padding
	fields which had previously been used up.

2002-10-21  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>
	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): include decset, osc, and window

2002-10-18 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c: use character constants instead of hex constants.
	* src/iso2022.txt: add more illustrations.
	* src/decset: scriptlet to save some typing.
	* src/vte.c: zero-terminate window and icon title strings again.
	* src/decset, src/osc, src/window: add.

2002-10-18 nalin
	* src/keymap.c: add a mapping for the escape key.

2002-10-18 nalin
	* src/vte.c: implement decset 42 (enable/disable NRC processing), but
	enable it by default.  Implement decset 44 (margin bell).
	* src/vte.c: do not trust the event->string.  Use gdk_keyval_to_unicode
	and the built-in keymapping to cope with the weirdness.  Extend the
	range of characters we controlify from 0x40-0x60 to 0x40-0x7f so that
	lower-case ascii chars controlify (not a word, I know).
	* src/keymap.c: add map entries for GDK_Return and GDK_KP_Enter for
	GDK_CONTROL_MASK = cr, normal = lf.

2002-10-18 nalin
	* src/vte.c: make sure that strings passed to a commit signal are zero-
	terminated (#96131).
	* python/Makefile.am: install the module in site-packages instead of a
	subdirectory, which doesn't work on my system.

2002-10-17 nalin
	* src/vte.c: remove vte_terminal_update_scroll_delta, which only did
	things vte_terminal_adjust_adjustments already did and was only called
	immediately after.  Fill newly-added lines with the current attributes
	if the current background isn't the default color (Red Hat #73853).
	Implement ignored DECSET settings, so that we don't mistakenly complain
	about settings not being implemented yet when we actually just want to
	ignore them.
	* vte.spec: 0.9.2

2002-10-17 nalin
	* src/vte.c: force the first cursor redraw after focus-in to always be
	in the foreground color (Red Hat #75908).

2002-10-17 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_insert_char): force invalidation mode if
	we're in insert mode to get the entire line redrawn.  Spotted by msw.

2002-10-17 nalin
	* configure.in: clean up tests for wint_t.  Patch from Brian Cameron.

2002-10-17 nalin
	* src/pty.c: close a possible race on systems where pty initialization
	requires more than just opening the pty (for example, Solaris).  Spotted
	by Brian Cameron.
	* src/utf8echo.c: don't reset to iso-8859-1 unless -r is used.

2002-10-16 nalin
	* src/vte.c: remove a bogus assertion for a case which we were already
	handling a little further down (incorrectly triggered by autowrap).

2002-10-16 nalin
	* src/vte.c: adjust our adjustments whenever a line might scroll off
	the top of the buffer.  Fix computation of the new insertion delta to
	ensure that it never goes below the scroll delta, which should fix the
	resizing crashes (#94509, #95187, Red Hat #75871), and add some debug
	assertions to verify this.
	* configure.in, python/Makefile.am: build the python bindings as a
	library, not a binary with wacky ldflags.

2002-10-15 nalin
	* src/vte.c: don't try to close the pty at finalize time if we didn't
	open it.  Patch from ha shao.
	* src/keymap.c, src/keymap.h: move the addition of modifiers into a
	separate function.  Add the function key strings from terminfo for
	fkey_sun and fkey_hp cases.  Make control+F1 = F13 only in vt220 mode.
	* src/vte.c: apply modifiers to function keys in normal and legacy
	modes.

2002-10-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c: add super-bogus bold text mode (Red Hat #74779).

2002-10-14 nalin
	* src/caps.c: recognize CSI-r (with no arguments) as resetting the
	scrolling region in XTerm emulation (Red Hat #75902).

2002-10-14 nalin
	* src/keymap.c: add mappings for GDK_Page_Up and GDK_Page_Down,
	missed in the conversion.
	* src/vte.c: steal GDK_KP_{Add,Subtract,Multiply,Divide} from the
	input methods (Red Hat #75207).

2002-10-14 nalin
	* configure.in: more $pkglibdir -> $libexecdir fixing.
	* doc/Makefile.am: add rules for generating ps and text versions of the
	ctlseqs docs.
	* doc/reference/tmpl/vte.sgml: add snippet for "commit".
	* python/python/vte.defs: update to add a binding for
	vte_terminal_fork_logged_command().
	* src/buffer.h: add a warning comment that these are private interfaces.
	Wrap declarations in G_BEGIN_DECLS/G_END_DECLS.
	* src/caps.h: add macros for the SS2/SS3 sequences.
	* src/marshal.list: add a marshaller for the "commit" signal.
	* src/keymap.c, src/keymap.h: move the getting-more-convoluted
	keypress-handling code to a shell that parses tables of static info.
	* src/vte.c: use the keymap for most non-printable keys.  Add a "commit"
	signal to allow an app to just use the terminal for displaying data and
	grabbing input (missing functionality noted by ha shao).  Obey the
	application's desired meta-sends-escape setting.  Recognize HP function
	key mode.  Recognize and handle legacy XTerm function key mode.  Force
	a redraw if the child application tries to switch to 80/132 columns,
	even though we don't usually let them succeed.  Don't try to send
	keystrokes to the child pty when there is no child pty.  Don't convert
	final whitespace to newlines when copying text (Red Hat #74611).
	* python/cat.py: test program for running without a command.
	* termcaps/xterm: change the definitions for ku/kd/kl/kr to match
	XTerm in normal cursor mode instead of application cursor mode.

2002-10-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c: properly distinguish cursor key mode and keypad key mode,
	obey application mode for cursor keys (#92941).
	* src/pty.c: reset signal handlers before exec() (Red Hat #75341).

2002-10-11 nalin
	* src/trie.c: change the typedef of wint_t here to match vte.c (now
	a gunichar instead of a long).  Spotted by Brian Cameron.

2002-10-11 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* configure.in: Changed to that wchar.h is included when checking for
	wint_t on Solaris.  This was needed because on Solaris wint_t is defined
	to be a long, and in vte.c its definition was recently changed to be a
	gunichar.  This caused the compile to break on Solaris.

2002-10-10 nalin
	* configure.in, src/pty.c, gnome-pty-helper/Makefile.am: fix the bits
	I missed when fixing #95085.

2002-10-10 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c, python/vte-demo.py: allow specifying the scrollback
	buffer size.
	* src/vte.c: if we don't have wint_t, typedef wint_t as a gunichar,
	not a long.

2002-10-09 nalin
	* src/buffer.c, src/buffer.h: add.
	* src/interpret.c, src/vte.c: use _vte_buffer structures instead of
	char arrays with separate lengths.  Use a scratch buffer for holding
	the results of conversions.
	* src/vte.c: separate the pango and pangox drawing paths so that they're
	easier to tweak and compare to each other.
	* src/vte.c: ditch the smooth scrolling change, which won't work right
	anyway (expose events don't get processed until after we finish
	processing a chunk of data unless we explicitly request it, so using a
	bbox is both simpler and faster).  Use a mask when creating the cursor
	we use for hiding the cursor.

2002-10-09 nalin
	* vte.spec, gnome-pty-helper/Makefile.am: install gnome-pty-helper into
	the libexecdir, not pkglibdir (#95085).
	* src/vte.c: obey smooth/jump scrolling options, default is jump scroll.

Mon Oct  7 14:53:12 2002  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>
	* src/vte.c (vte_font_match): Fix over-aggressive 
	Xft => Fc conversion - need to call XftDefaultSubstitute to pick up Xft
	X resources, not FcDefaultSubstitute.

2002-10-01  Stanislav Brabec  <sbrabec@suse.cz>

	* configure.in: Added cs to ALL_LINGUAS.

2002-09-24 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_word_chars,vte_terminal_is_word_char):
	if the list of word characters is NULL or zero-length, try to guess
	with (g_unichar_isgraph() && !g_unichar_ispunct()), which seems to
	produce reasonable results (#77134).

2002-09-24 nalin
	* gnome-pty-helper/acinclude.m4: Fix HAVE_UT_UT_TV for cases where
	the static initializer might not work right (#93774, patch from
	Kalpesh Shah).

2002-09-24 nalin
	* README, gnome-pty-helper/README:  Doc fixups (mention gnome-terminal
	instead of profterm, note the proper permissions for gnome-pty-helper,
	#84505).

2002-09-20 nalin
	* src/ring.c: Fix a ring-buffer manipulation bug (Red Hat #74290) which
	might cause a new item to be inserted in the wrong location.

2002-09-19 nalin
	* src/interpret.c: Munge input data the way the terminal does so that
	conversion failures don't wedge us.

2002-09-19 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Backed out scrolldelay patches from 09-17 and 09-18 at
	Nalin's request.  Left in the patch which allows programs which 
	update the screen non-linearly like lynx to work properly.

2002-09-18 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Corrected a problem with yesterday's patch.  I am now
	properly calling g_source_remove on the scroll_delay timeout
	function.  This prevents VTE from core dumping if you start up
	more than one VTE gnome-terminal and exit from one of them.  Also
	made the vte_scroll_timeout function a little cleaner by using
	the VTE_IS_TERMINAL macro.

2002-09-17 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Fixed bug with my 09/11 speedup fix which caused programs
	that update the screen non-linearly like lynx to update incorrectly.
	Also included a speed improvement which delays the scroll-down for
	70ms.  Too fast to be noticeable to the user, but it speeds up VTE
	greatly.

2002-09-13 nalin
	* src/pty.c: Fix typo which broke builds on systems where MSG_NOSIGNAL
	is defined.

2002-09-12 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* configure.in : Added -lsocket to LIBS if socket is in libsocket,
	so VTE will compile on Solaris.

2002-09-12  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* src/pty.c: only use MSG_NOSIGNAL if it's defined

	* gnome-pty-helper/gnome-pty-helper.c (struct pty_info): remove
	master_fd and slave_fd fields
	(shutdown_pty): don't close master/slave fd's here...
	(pty_add): don't take master/slave fd args
	(open_ptys): ...close master/slave fd's right after passing them

	this fixes a hang after closing a window on os x, not sure why...

	* gnome-pty-helper/Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): remove
	trailing / after $DESTDIR

	* configure.in: AC_CHECK_FUNC() doesn't do AC_DEFINE(HAVE_FOO), so
	do that for socket() and socketpair() if they are found

2002-09-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_invalidate_cursor_once): Remove the invalidate_cells
	parameter, because the function is a big no-op if FALSE, in which case
	we should just not call it instead. (vte_terminal_process_incoming):
	refresh the right number of rows after processing a block of data.

2002-09-12 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c Fixed minor error with my previous patch.  This just makes
	a warning go away.
  
2002-09-11 nalin
	* src/pty.c: Reorder definitions to avoid implicit declaration warnings.
	* configure.in: Check for socketpair().  Check for socket() in libc
	before poking around in libsocket.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Get smarter about when it's necessary to start messing

	scrollback data.

2002-08-30 nalin

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Restore the focus-in/focus-out handlers -- the defaults
	don't quite DTRT for us because they miss our im_context (#72946).  When
	setting the cursor location for the input method, make the Y coordinate
	relative to the window, not the scrollback buffer.  When resizing the

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Only perform cr-lf substitutions when pasting text, not
	when inputting from a live user (Red Hat #72639).  Bind GDK_ISO_Left_Tab
	to kB.  Formatting changes.
	* termcaps/xterm: Bind kB to back-tab (Red Hat #70340).

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't tamper with the scrolling offsets -- they're updated
	when we handle adjustment_changed notifications.  Scroll instead of just
	moving the cursor down when soft-wrapping to the next line.  Avoid
	emitting adjustment_changed when only the value has changed, likewise
	for the value and the other fields of the adjustment.

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Keep cursor position and scrolling offsets from going
	wonky when you resize, especially on the alternate screen.  Suppress
	duplicate adjustment_changed notifications.
	* src/vteapp.c: Set the MIN_SIZE geometry hints so that we can resize
	to unreasonably-small dimensions.
	* src/ring.c, src/ring.h: Add vte_ring_new_with_delta().

	VTE_USE_XFT.  Spotted by hp.

2002-08-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Heed the reverse-video setting when painting character
	cells again.  Make selection and matching coordinates global, fixing
	the selecting-while-scrolling case.  Prevent overdraws into the padding
	area on the right.

2002-08-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Make nd() move right but not wrap -- according to Strang
	it's undefined, but xterm doesn't wrap it.  Separate do/DO from sf/SF
	and up/UP from sr/SR, because the scrolling behavior is supposed to be
	different.  Add support for decset/decreset 7 (wraparound mode) and
	1051 (Sun keyboard).  Add support for DECALN.  Remove some type checks
	from run-time which the compiler can catch with certainty.

2002-08-25  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/vteapp.c: Set geometry hints using the initial font setup.
2002-08-22 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Make use of the visible bell a separate option
	from use of the audible bell, allowing both/neither to be used.  Open
	fonts right away again -- profterm reads the metrics right after calling
	set_font(), so we have to open fonts ASAP.  Rework the Xft/Pango/Xlib
	decision code to be more consistent.  Watch for style changes and reset
	our font to the new style's font when we're already using the old
	style's font.
2002-08-21 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c(vte_iso2022_substitute): Take a vte_table as an

	sequence, even if it's in shifted-out text.
	* src/table.c(vte_table_match): Speed up for the no-arguments-requested
	case, which just became much more common.
2002-08-21 nalin

	PangoX startup time.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Unref the output channel one more time when we're done
	sending data to the child.  Free the background data GDK property when
	we're finished with it.  Don't retrieve the pango context when drawing
	unless Xft has already been disabled.  Don't try to use the pango layout
	to draw unless it's valid.  Don't try to use the XftDraw item to draw
	unless it's valid.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Dispose of the updated substitution context properly when
	processing blocks of input text.  Spotted by Arjan van de Ven.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/ring.c: Debug when rows get freed.
	* src/vte.c: Maybe-release pango contexts after unreffing layouts which
	refer to them.  Decide on how we want to draw fonts before deciding
	which fonts to draw, to avoid spurious font loading.  Remove output tags
	when the output tag's callback is about to return FALSE.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't leak the hintstyle and rgba settings.  Patch from
	Arjan van de Ven.  Free PangoX contexts when we're done with them,
	spotted by Arjan van de Ven.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Load fonts just-in-time to avoid spurious reloads.  Don't

2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c: Handle override maps which don't affect the font

	bogon data correctly.
	* src/iso2022.txt: Add some sample text.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fixup some fontconfig/Xft mixups.  Set the hint style
	instead of hinting when reading the GTK hint style setting (spotted
	by katzj and otaylor).
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.h, src/vte.c: Use gssize instead of ssize_t.  Perform
	substitutions while processing.  Use PangoX contexts when we're using
	the PangoX fontmap and when doing PangoX rendering.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/mkunitables.sh,src/unitable.*: Add.
	* src/iso2022.c, src/iso2022.h: Use unitables.

	gets cleared to the background.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_locale_encoding): don't try to second-guess
	the local encoding, just use the current charset as returned by
	g_get_charset().
2002-08-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_reset): drop pending incoming data on reset.
	* src/vte.c: give reprocessing of pending input data a higher priority
	than reading it from the child to prevent backlogs on corrupt or invalid
	multibyte data from building up and whacking us exponentially.
2002-08-13 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_delete_lines): initialize lines added

2002-08-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint,vte_terminal_draw_cells): fill in the
	background color when drawing the cursor, even if it's going to end up
	as the default background color, spotted by Peter Jones.  Draw the
	cursor correctly if it's over a graphic character.
2002-08-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_cells): once again, avoid drawing NULs.

	* src/vte.c: Clean up use of various G_PRIORITY values throughout to
	allow for simpler tuning.  Rewrite rendering code to use per-paint
	PangoLayouts when they're needed, use Xft2's DrawCharSpec function when

	* configure.in: Check for wint_t and attempt to allow compiles even
	when wint_t isn't defined (this type is used only debug code, so it
	shouldn't break anything).
	* src/caps.c: Remove "te" and "ti", which are logical, in the same way
	"so" is, from the known capabilities lists.  Add a "is a key" field to
	the termcap list so that we don't match against keystrokes in case
	they're also control sequences.
	* src/interpret.c: Use tables instead of tries.  Don't add key sequences
	to the table.
	* src/pty.c: Fix incorrect invocation in sample.
	* src/reaper.c: Include stdlib.h to quiet compiler warning.
	* src/trie.c, src/trie.h: Remove the unused precomputing routines.
	* src/utf8echo.c: Switch to link with tables instead of tries.
	* src/vte.c: Switch to using tables instead of tries.  Map
	cursor-backward to LE instead of le, which handles parameters right.
	Don't add key sequences to the parsing table.  Tune updates so that
	they occur less often when we're processing large amounts of data from
	the child.  Add a 'status-line-changed' signal.  Implement fs() and
	fix ts().  Add ::get_status_line() to get the contents of the status
	line.  Obey it() when setting default tabstops.  Implement
	cursor_next_line(), cursor_lower_left(), cursor_preceding_line(),
	cursor_horizontal_and_vertical_position(), erase_characters(), and
	insert_blank_characters().  Implement nw().

2002-07-26  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Initialize new lines added for al().  Spotted by jrb.

2002-07-25  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* configure.in: Added Danish translation.

2002-07-25  nalin
	* README: Note that bold isn't broken any more.
	* termcaps/xterm: Note that k; was added.
	* src/pty.c: Set the proper number of columns in the window size.
	* src/ring.h: Change macro argument names to hopefully not step on
	application code.
	* src/vte.c: Set the terminal size to the default size as specified in
	termcap at init-time.
2002-07-24  nalin
	* src/pty.c: Add private vte_pty_set_size() function.
	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h: vte_pty_open() takes size arguments now.
	* src/vte.c: Open the PTY with the proper initial size.
2002-07-23  nalin
	* src/ring.c, ring.h: Expose the ring implementation and convert several
	simple functions into macros.
	* src/vteapp.c: Pass all long options on to gtk_init().
2002-07-23  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix realize/unrealize to be properly reversible.  Use the
	font from the default style unless we're explicitly given one.
	* src/vteapp.c: Don't set base size or minimum size geometry hints when
	sizing the terminal widget.
2002-07-22  nalin
	* src/pty.c(vte_pty_ptsname): Fix an incorrect logic check.
2002-07-19  nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_color_internal): If we're changing the
	background color, apply it to the widget's window as well, from msw.
2002-07-19  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Undo the scrolling changes -- there too many combinations
	of circumstances that cause them to not work right.
2002-07-18  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fudge the repaint line count by one when scrolling regions
	to ensure that the old cursor gets repainted.  Calculate the area which
	needs to be repainted when reverse-scrolling correctly.
2002-07-18  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement enough of set-mode and reset-mode to allow
	toggling of insert mode using this sequence.  Move all scrolling into
	vte_terminal_scroll_region and use gdk_draw_drawable to avoid repainting
	from scratch whenever possible.
2002-07-17  nalin
	* configure.in: Actually set ALL_LINGUAS so translations get installed.
	* README: Document the weirdness that is cursor movement around wide
	characters.
	* src/vte.defs: Bind set_color_bold().
	* src/debug.c: Suppress warnings when $VTE_DEBUG_FLAGS isn't set.
	* src/pty.c, src/reaper.c, src/termcap.c, src/trie.c: Provide for
	debug messages in the test program.
	* src/interpret.c, src/trie.c: Use libc stdio instead of g_print for
	printing what might be part of a multibyte sequence because g_print
	checks for validity.
	* src/interpret.c, src/trie.c, src/utf8echo.c, src/vte.c: Use gunichar
	instead of wchar_t in places where a gunichar is expected.  Provide a
	means for converting from wchar_t to gunichar for the sake of X11 calls
	which want a wchar_t.
	* src/trie.c: Provide vte_trie_wide_encoding() for finding a giconv
	target which is hopefully compatible with gunichar.  Likewise provide
	vte_trie_narrow_encoding() to find one compatible with iso-8859-1.
	* src/vte.c: Fall back to ISO-8859-1 if we can't set things up for the
	current locale encoding at startup time.  Fall back to the current
	encoding if we can't perform a given dynamic switch.
2002-07-16  nalin
	* configure.in: Set GETTEXT_PACKAGE correctly, noted by menthos.

2002-07-16  nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_colors): Guess at an appropriate bold
	version of the foreground color instead of hard-coding in a default.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h (vte_terminal_set_color_bold): Add.

2002-07-16  nalin
	* src/trie.c: Correctly check for g_iconv_open() failure.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_encoding): Try to give a meaningful
	error when g_iconv_open() fails, even though we're screwed.

2002-07-15  nalin
	* src/vte.c: wrap the new Xft/fontconfig-specific code in HAVE_XFT
	* src/vte.c: Revert some changes in how new cells were initialized,
	removing various cosmetic problems.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_process_incoming): Discard the proper number
	of characters when we don't recognize a sequence, previously we left
	one byte that should have been removed.

2002-07-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_cursor_position): decrement spaces
	as we go through the loop, it was nice and infinite.

2002-07-13 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_text): Add the proper number of attribute
	structs to the attribute array to fix crashes which occurred when the
	buffer contains non-ASCII text (Red Hat #67930).
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Small optimization in the al() and dl() handlers.  al()
	doesn't move the cursor, per GNU termcap docs.  Check for a pixbuf in
	the bgfx check instead of pixmap, which was the wrong type.
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Add patch to heed Xft/fontconfig settings as kept by GTK.
	Based on patch from otaylor.
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/slowcat.c: Added.
	* src/vteapp.c: Add -a/-b flags to control audible bell and blinking
	cursors.  Only send "pwd" as an initial command if there wasn't a
	command specified on the command line.  Add a simple help message.
	* src/vte.c: Bind F13-F35 per termcap.  Treat GDK_KP_Delete as
	GDK_Delete.  Map Ctrl+F1-F12 to F13-F24.  Fix dc() to ensure that the
	rows stays full and that newly-added cells get the default attributes.
	Fix cl() to clear all rows on the screen with the default attributes
	(bce).  Default to using Xft if available for consistency with GTK.
2002-07-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Treat super, hyper, meta, and alt as modifiers when
	deciding to scroll-on-keypress.  Noted by jrb.
	* src/vte.c: Always map \r and \n to cr and so, even when they're
	defined by the termcap.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Rework how default colors are set up, and add
	vte_terminal_set_color_foreground and vte_terminal_set_color_background.
	* src/vte.h: Remove includes for local headers which apps are not
	likely to never use, cleaning up the namespace a little.
	* python/vte.defs: Bind vte_terminal_set_color_{fore,back}ground.
	* src/debug.h, src/ring.h: Use G_BEGIN_DECLS/G_END_DECLS.
	* src/reaper.h: Use G_BEGIN_DECLS/G_END_DECLS in the right place.
	* src/vteapp.c: Add -B/-T flags to set background images and
	transparency.
2002-07-02 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Make shift+button1 extend selection.
2002-07-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_draw_char): Draw unicode line-drawing code
	points natively as we do for the GR1 support, in case the current font
	doesn't include glyphs for them.
	* src/vte.c: Test for g_iconv_open() failure properly (compare result
	to ((GIConv)-1), not NULL).
	* src/vte.c: Rework recovery from illegal sequence errors in the input
	stream to be much more aggressive about it.
2002-06-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Bind F10 to "k;", not "k0".
	* termcaps/xterm: Add "k;" defined as F10.
2002-06-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_reset_rowdata): Check for redundant resizes.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_scrollback_lines): Keep the alternate
	screen buffer size the same as the window height, because xterm's
	alternate screen doesn't backscroll.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_text): Don't append spaces to multicolumn
	characters when reading the screen's contents.
	* src/vte.c: Don't overexpose neighboring cells any more.  Cleanups.
	* src/ring.h, src/ring.c: Add vte_ring_max() to read a ring's maximum
	size.
2002-06-24 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal): Treat option 1049
	as a combination of 1047 and 1048.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_finalize): When finalizing while holding the
	selection, throw the selection onto the clipboard without an owner so
	that it doesn't just disappear.
2002-06-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_set_title_int): Fix a logic bug
	that got rid of the title always, not just when conversion failed.
2002-06-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Clear the alternate screen when switching to it.
2002-06-18 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix refs/derefs with IOChannels and sources.  Clean up
	I/O GIConv descriptors at finalize-time.
2002-06-18 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Make cursor_visible a widget-wide (not per-screen) setting.
2002-06-18 nalin
	* autogen.sh: Correct automake version check to require 1.5, heads
	up from Glynn Foster.
2002-06-18 nalin
	* src/trie.c (vte_trie_match, vte_trie_match_x): Sort out greedy vs.
	non-greedy pattern matching.
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal): Make 1047 an alias
	for 47 (use alternate buffer), and handle cursor save/restore properly.
2002-06-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h (vte_terminal_fork_command): Add a parameter for
	passing in environment variables to add.
	* src/termcap.c: Preprocess out unused comment() and generate() funcs.
	* src/Makefile.am: Bump library version number.
	* vte.spec: 0.4.0
2002-06-14 nalin
	* configure.in, python/Makefile.am: Handle cases where pygtk isn't
	installed in the prefix we're configuring for.
	* src/Makefile.am: Link libvte to its library dependencies.
2002-06-13 nalin
	* src/vteaccess.c: Stop watching for hierarchy-changed signals -- the
	accessible container which is our parent handles it already (from msw).
2002-06-13 nalin
	* src/vteaccess.c: Re-read cursor position immediately on "cursor-moved"
	events, and emit the "text-caret-moved" signal then as well.  Don't
	override the signal handlers for signals we emit, bad things can
	happen (from msw).
2002-06-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Re-read the termcap when we change emulation, because
	the location of the file may have changed.
	* src/reaper.c: Also tell the parent the child died when the child
	dies due to an uncaught signal.
	* python/vte.override (_wrap_vte_terminal_fork_command): Handle default
	value for the command.
2002-06-12 msw
	* python/vte.override (_wrap_vte_terminal_fork_command): implement
2002-06-12 msw
	* acinclude.m4: added AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS from pygtk
	* configure.in: rewrote python checks to be more robust
	* python/Makefile.am (CFLAGS): include @PYTHON_INCLUDES@
2002-06-12 msw
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_accessible): turn the logic around
	to be the right way
2002-06-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Cache the result of vte_terminal_get_accessible() and
	unref it at finalize-time.  Add debug messages to log signals emitted
	by the widget.  Implement vte_terminal_get_encoding and
	vte_terminal_get_emulation, emit signals when these change.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Emit a "text_caret_moved" signal when the cursor
	moves.
	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Add rules for building python modules.
2002-06-12 msw
	* src/vteaccess.c (vte_terminal_accessible_get_text): accept
	end_offset of -1, which means "until the end".
	* src/vteaccess.c (vte_terminal_accessible_new): never set the
	description to a NULL pointer
2002-06-10 nalin
	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Include gettext support.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Expose vte_terminal_set_encoding().
	* src/vte.c: Finish merging otaylor's Xft2 patch (oops).  Compute
	padding correctly.
	* src/pty.c, src/reaper.c, src/trie.c, src/vte.c: Mark warnings for
	possible translation.
2002-06-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Center characters in their cells, caching their extents.
2002-06-06 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Add get_cursor_position(). Remove get_snapshot()
	and free_shapshot().
	* src/vte.c: Fix a logic bug that caused us to scroll to the bottom
	even if the user just pressed and released a modifier key.  Fix saving
	of the font in set_font() in most cases, where we weren't saving the
	new font before.  Scroll-to-bottom on input method commits, which are
	also the result of keystrokes, when scroll-on-keystroke is enabled.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Rework to use get_text() and get_cursor_position()
	instead of get_snapshot(), so that selection and accessibility both
	agree on what's visible (or "visible").
2002-06-05 nalin
	* configure.in: Check for pangoxft with Xft1 or Xft2, hopefully getting
	things right for either case.  Originally from patch by andersca.
	* src/reaper.c, src/reaper.h: Add a singleton object to watch for
	SIGCHLD when child processes quit.
	* src/vte.c: Emit a "child-exited" signal when a child started with
	fork_command() exits.
	* src/vte.c: Make a better guess at font metrics when using Xft by
	measuring the extents for a string of representative characters.
	* src/vte.defs: Add.  Not very useful yet.
2002-05-31 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement font setting using PangoX to convert Pango
	font descriptions to core font xlfds for use when drawing with Xlib.
2002-05-29 nalin
	* src/trie.c, src,vte.c: Finish switching iconv to g_iconv.  I think
	this was a part of Hidetoshi Tajima's patch that I lost.  Free regexes
	when we're done with them.
2002-05-28 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix matching when scrolling delta isn't zero.  Fix async
	background updating (report from Richard Neal Plana).  Fix cb() and ce()
	when the cursor is on a line without data (needed to create it) and when
	cells being cleared don't exist (needed to create them) (report from
	Garret LeSage).
	* src/vte.c, src/vteaccess.c: Always free the segment when freeing
	arrays and strings.

2002-05-24 nalin
	* autogen.sh: Call libtoolize. (#82836)
	* src/vte.c: Fix stupid segfault in set_scrollback_lines.  (Patch
	from notting.)  Make another attempt to convert Pango font descriptions
	to xlfds.
	* src/vteapp.c: Add -c, -f, -t command-line flags for easier testing.

2002-05-22 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix hiliting of matched strings.

2002-05-21 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Filter key release events through input methods.  (Patch
	from otaylor.)  When building with gcc, use -std=c99.

2002-05-21 nalin
	* autogen.sh, src/termcap.c, src/utf8echo.c, src/vte.c: Patch from
	Hidetoshi Tajima to fix building on Solaris systems, remove use of
	syntax that might be specific to gcc, and fix an overrun in
	vte_termcap_generate().  (#82433)

2002-05-18 andersca
	* src/vte.c: Don't queue a background update if the background isn't
	transparent.

2002-05-16 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Snip trailing whitespace off of copied lines, insert
	an end-of-line only when the copied line doesn't go to the right edge,
	don't overrun right edge, even in insert mode.  Fix displaying of
	underlined text.  Finish implementing matching.

2002-05-15 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Send kI on insert key.  Don't send drag events when the
	child has only asked for click events.  Fix crashbugs in selection.
	When getting scroll events, send mouse 4/5 events to the child instead
	of performing a history scroll if the child wants mouse events.  Start
	adding match support, merging how selection views the buffer with how
	matching views the buffer, though matching doesn't work yet.

2002-05-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't try to draw nul characters, most fonts can't.  Don't
	send motion-tracking events to the child unless we're dragging.  Fix
	ce so that it works even right after startup.  Make sure that repainting
	the entire window actually exposes the visible parts of the window.  Fix
	tab clearing to also allow removal of the current tabstop.  Implement
	save-mode and restore-mode.  Start on reverse-video mode.  Don't scroll
	on modifier keypress events.  Rework part of clipboard copy.
	* termcaps/xterm: Add missing F11/F12/End keysyms to bundled xterm
	termcap.
2002-05-13 nalin
	* src/debug.c: Add "ALL" as a debug flag, aliased to everything.
	* src/pty.c: Print debug info after redirecting stdio.
	* src/trie.c: When debugging, count only decision nodes.
	* src/vte.c: Fix se, for real this time.  Add a mostly-ignored protected
	attribute.  Handle am, bw, ul flags properly.  Make cd clear the current
	line, too.  Make ce fill the current default attributes through the end
	of the line.  Handle cS.  Fix cv to work when we have a scrollback
	buffer.  Handle ll, mp.  Line wrap on nd.  Reset tab stops on hard
	reset only.  Handle soft-reset and full-reset.  Handle uc.  Initialize
	scrollback line count properly.  Tweak drawing of alternate 'a' to
	get rid of artifacts.  Reset insert mode, cursor visibility, and
	scrolling regions when resetting.
2002-05-10 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix IC, which should *always* be done in insert mode,
	from otaylor.  Make delete mode do nothing.
2002-05-09 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fixes to usage of iconv, from otaylor.  Remap certain
	characters which are missing in the current Xft font to similar
	characters if they are in the font, from otaylor.  Change default
	emulation to "xterm", cleaning up confusion over what standout really
	means.  Reorganize some internals.  Complain when an application sends
	us a key-press sequence, as if we knew what to do with one of those.
	Implement bt, ct, st.  Reimplement ta.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: Added.
2002-05-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement mouse motion-event and any-event tracking.
2002-05-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement the rest of the special graphics characters.
2002-05-06 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Finish implementing window-manipulation sequences.  Rename
	signals to be more consistent.  Add thin wrappers for emitting signals,
	and use them everywhere.  Support pangox even when XFT isn't available.
	Try to provide bold text again.  Add signals for most of the window
	manipulation control sequences.  Start handling mouse button events.
	Hide the mouse cursor when we get keyboard events.  Use a different
	mouse cursor if the child is mouse-aware.  Handle eA() by treating it as
	as().
	* src/caps.c, src/caps.h: Export definitions of VTE_CAP_CSI and friends.
2002-05-04 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement device-status-report and dec-device-status-
	report.  Clamp location values in sequence_handler_cm() to the
	dimensions of the terminal window so that resize(1) will work right.
	Start handling window-manipulation sequences.
2002-05-03 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Export a vte_termcap_strip() function for preprocessing
	escape sequences and whatnot from capability values.
	* src/typescrypt: Removed.
	* src/vte.c: Pass the hard-coded xterm-specific capabilities through
	vte_termcap_strip(), which fixes a few weird bugs.  Discard invalid
	might-be-control-sequence sequences, like other emulators do.  Don't
	consider modifier keys, by themselves, to be enough to scroll-on-key.
	When snapshotting, actually snapshot all of a row instead of just the
	last character.  Don't run past the end of snapshot contents when
	reading them.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Clamp offsets so that they always sort right.
2002-05-02 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Fix handling of triple-digit escaped characters,
	which weren't being processed right if the first digit was '1' instead
	of '0'.
	* src/trie.c: Rework trie matching to return the address of the
	character which ended the match attempt, which should cut down on
	useless initial-substring checks.  Fix a subtle bug which caused
	intermittent off-by-somenumber errors in the return address.
	* src/vte.c:  Remove several gdk_window_scroll() calls which apparently
	aren't buffered.  Convert invalid multibyte characters to '?' instead of
	just dropping them.  Provide a means of setting the backspace/delete
	bindings.  Add a poor xlfd_from_pango mapping function which would need
	serious work to be useful.  Get rid of warnings when we're transparent
	and the root window pixmap isn't as big as the root window because it's
	been tiled.  Setup bindings using the export functions.  Set the default
	terminal size to 80x24 instead of 60x18, which was originally chosen for
	debugging purposes.  Don't use $SHELL as the command to invoke when
	starting up a default command (as in the test app) -- libtool wrappers
	keep screwing this up.  Don't limit the number of characters we skip
	over in invalid multibyte sequences -- sometimes that's not enough.
	Hook up ts/te, ks/ke sequence handlers.
	* src/vteaccess.h: Fix a crashbug due to mismatch between parent field
	in the object's structure and its inherited object's type.  Fix more
	crash bugs due to initialization weirdness.  More to go.
2002-05-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Try @pkgdatadir@/termcap/$TERM when reading termcap files.
	This fixes the app on systems with no /etc/termcap, and also speeds up
	loads and reduces memory consumption for xterm-color at the expense of
	making on-the-fly emulation changes impossible.  Don't xor reverse with
	itself when drawing characters (this broke when snapshotting was added).
	* termcaps/Makefile.am, termcaps/xterm-color: include a default termcap
	for xterm-color.
	* src/termcap.c src/termcap.h: make _find_boolean return a gboolean
	instead of an int.
	
2002-04-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Disconnect from toplevel window_configure events at
	finalize-time.

2002-04-30 18:06  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Track and free idle task tags properly.  Change F11 and
	F12 capabilities from 'k;' and 'F1' to 'F1' and 'F2'.  Send a NUL on
	control space. (#80350)  Allow setting and checking of word characters,
	and change select-by-word behavior to use the word character list.
	Emit "contents_changed" signals whenever the visible contents change,
	and "cursor_moved" when the cursor moves.  Add snapshotting method.
	Scroll when auto-margin handling moves the cursor to the next line.
	Assume that the locale charset is actually ISO-8859-1 when we're in
	a UTF-8 locale, so we don't toggle from UTF-8 to UTF-8.  Treat
	GDK_KP_Page_Up as a GDK_Page_Up, ditto for GDK_KP_Page_Down and
	GDK_KP_Tab and GDK_KP_Space.  Add vte_terminal_get_font().  Don't bother
	messing with ring buffers if we're resizing them to their current sizes.
	* src/pty.c, src/vte.c: Return a pid from vte_terminal_fork_command().
	* src/vteaccess.c, src/vteaccess.h: Add VteTerminalAccessible object
	type.  It might even work, mostly.

2002-04-29 14:25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle me() by resetting all attributes (including
	colors, which we weren't resetting before).

2002-04-29 10:57  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle kb by treating it as a backspace.  Make pangox
	rendering the default.  Handle control-key sequences better, unless
	the input method is hiding the modifiers from us.  Set the default
	TERM variable to "xterm-color".
	* src/vte.c src/vte.h: Get rid of vte_terminal_set_core_font().

2002-04-26 19:14  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Punt all changes to background images and transparency
	to an idle task.  Only insert newlines into the copy buffer when the

	scrollback size changes.
	* src/vteapp.c: set a default scrollback buffer size of 100.
2002-04-26 00:49  nalin

2002-02-27 00:05  nalin

	* autogen.sh, configure.in, src/vte.c, src/vte.h: - Add sub-optimal
	Xft rendering (set VTE_USE_XFT to "1" to try it); still needs
