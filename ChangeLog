	* src/vte.c: Snip trailing whitespace off of copied lines, insert
	an end-of-line only when the copied line doesn't go to the right edge,
	don't overrun right edge, even in insert mode.  Fix displaying of
	underlined text.  Finish implementing matching.
2002-05-15 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Send kI on insert key.  Don't send drag events when the
	child has only asked for click events.  Fix crashbugs in selection.
	When getting scroll events, send mouse 4/5 events to the child instead
	of performing a history scroll if the child wants mouse events.  Start
	adding match support, merging how selection views the buffer with how
	matching views the buffer, though matching doesn't work yet.
2002-05-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't try to draw nul characters, most fonts can't.  Don't
	send motion-tracking events to the child unless we're dragging.  Fix
	ce so that it works even right after startup.  Make sure that repainting
	the entire window actually exposes the visible parts of the window.  Fix
	tab clearing to also allow removal of the current tabstop.  Implement
	save-mode and restore-mode.  Start on reverse-video mode.  Don't scroll
	on modifier keypress events.  Rework part of clipboard copy.
	* termcaps/xterm: Add missing F11/F12/End keysyms to bundled xterm
	termcap.
2002-05-13 nalin
	* src/debug.c: Add "ALL" as a debug flag, aliased to everything.
	* src/pty.c: Print debug info after redirecting stdio.
	* src/trie.c: When debugging, count only decision nodes.
	* src/vte.c: Fix se, for real this time.  Add a mostly-ignored protected
	attribute.  Handle am, bw, ul flags properly.  Make cd clear the current
	line, too.  Make ce fill the current default attributes through the end
	of the line.  Handle cS.  Fix cv to work when we have a scrollback
	buffer.  Handle ll, mp.  Line wrap on nd.  Reset tab stops on hard
	reset only.  Handle soft-reset and full-reset.  Handle uc.  Initialize
	scrollback line count properly.  Tweak drawing of alternate 'a' to
	get rid of artifacts.  Reset insert mode, cursor visibility, and
	scrolling regions when resetting.
2002-05-10 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix IC, which should *always* be done in insert mode,
	from otaylor.  Make delete mode do nothing.
2002-05-09 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fixes to usage of iconv, from otaylor.  Remap certain
	characters which are missing in the current Xft font to similar
	characters if they are in the font, from otaylor.  Change default
	emulation to "xterm", cleaning up confusion over what standout really
	means.  Reorganize some internals.  Complain when an application sends
	us a key-press sequence, as if we knew what to do with one of those.
	Implement bt, ct, st.  Reimplement ta.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: Added.
2002-05-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement mouse motion-event and any-event tracking.
2002-05-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement the rest of the special graphics characters.
2002-05-06 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Finish implementing window-manipulation sequences.  Rename
	signals to be more consistent.  Add thin wrappers for emitting signals,
	and use them everywhere.  Support pangox even when XFT isn't available.
	Try to provide bold text again.  Add signals for most of the window
	manipulation control sequences.  Start handling mouse button events.
	Hide the mouse cursor when we get keyboard events.  Use a different
	mouse cursor if the child is mouse-aware.  Handle eA() by treating it as
	as().
	* src/caps.c, src/caps.h: Export definitions of VTE_CAP_CSI and friends.
2002-05-04 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement device-status-report and dec-device-status-
	report.  Clamp location values in sequence_handler_cm() to the
	dimensions of the terminal window so that resize(1) will work right.
	Start handling window-manipulation sequences.
2002-05-03 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Export a vte_termcap_strip() function for preprocessing
	escape sequences and whatnot from capability values.
	* src/typescrypt: Removed.
	* src/vte.c: Pass the hard-coded xterm-specific capabilities through
	vte_termcap_strip(), which fixes a few weird bugs.  Discard invalid
	might-be-control-sequence sequences, like other emulators do.  Don't
	consider modifier keys, by themselves, to be enough to scroll-on-key.
	When snapshotting, actually snapshot all of a row instead of just the
	last character.  Don't run past the end of snapshot contents when
	reading them.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Clamp offsets so that they always sort right.
2002-05-02 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Fix handling of triple-digit escaped characters,
	which weren't being processed right if the first digit was '1' instead
	of '0'.
	* src/trie.c: Rework trie matching to return the address of the
	character which ended the match attempt, which should cut down on
	useless initial-substring checks.  Fix a subtle bug which caused
	intermittent off-by-somenumber errors in the return address.
	* src/vte.c:  Remove several gdk_window_scroll() calls which apparently
	aren't buffered.  Convert invalid multibyte characters to '?' instead of
	just dropping them.  Provide a means of setting the backspace/delete
	bindings.  Add a poor xlfd_from_pango mapping function which would need
	serious work to be useful.  Get rid of warnings when we're transparent
	and the root window pixmap isn't as big as the root window because it's
	been tiled.  Setup bindings using the export functions.  Set the default
	terminal size to 80x24 instead of 60x18, which was originally chosen for
	debugging purposes.  Don't use $SHELL as the command to invoke when
	starting up a default command (as in the test app) -- libtool wrappers
	keep screwing this up.  Don't limit the number of characters we skip
	over in invalid multibyte sequences -- sometimes that's not enough.
	Hook up ts/te, ks/ke sequence handlers.
	* src/vteaccess.h: Fix a crashbug due to mismatch between parent field
	in the object's structure and its inherited object's type.  Fix more
	crash bugs due to initialization weirdness.  More to go.
2002-05-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Try @pkgdatadir@/termcap/$TERM when reading termcap files.
	This fixes the app on systems with no /etc/termcap, and also speeds up
	loads and reduces memory consumption for xterm-color at the expense of
	making on-the-fly emulation changes impossible.  Don't xor reverse with
	itself when drawing characters (this broke when snapshotting was added).
	* termcaps/Makefile.am, termcaps/xterm-color: include a default termcap
	for xterm-color.
	* src/termcap.c src/termcap.h: make _find_boolean return a gboolean
	instead of an int.
	
2002-04-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Disconnect from toplevel window_configure events at
	finalize-time.

2002-04-30 18:06  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Track and free idle task tags properly.  Change F11 and
	F12 capabilities from 'k;' and 'F1' to 'F1' and 'F2'.  Send a NUL on
	control space. (#80350)  Allow setting and checking of word characters,
	and change select-by-word behavior to use the word character list.
	Emit "contents_changed" signals whenever the visible contents change,
	and "cursor_moved" when the cursor moves.  Add snapshotting method.
	Scroll when auto-margin handling moves the cursor to the next line.
	Assume that the locale charset is actually ISO-8859-1 when we're in
	a UTF-8 locale, so we don't toggle from UTF-8 to UTF-8.  Treat
	GDK_KP_Page_Up as a GDK_Page_Up, ditto for GDK_KP_Page_Down and
	GDK_KP_Tab and GDK_KP_Space.  Add vte_terminal_get_font().  Don't bother
	messing with ring buffers if we're resizing them to their current sizes.
	* src/pty.c, src/vte.c: Return a pid from vte_terminal_fork_command().
	* src/vteaccess.c, src/vteaccess.h: Add VteTerminalAccessible object
	type.  It might even work, mostly.

2002-04-29 14:25  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle me() by resetting all attributes (including
	colors, which we weren't resetting before).

2002-04-29 10:57  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle kb by treating it as a backspace.  Make pangox
	rendering the default.  Handle control-key sequences better, unless
	the input method is hiding the modifiers from us.  Set the default
	TERM variable to "xterm-color".
	* src/vte.c src/vte.h: Get rid of vte_terminal_set_core_font().

2002-04-26 19:14  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Punt all changes to background images and transparency
	to an idle task.  Only insert newlines into the copy buffer when the
	last column in a given line doesn't have a character in it.
2002-04-26 17:35  notting

	* src/Makefile.am, src/ring.c, ring.h: add a ring buffer for storing
	scrollback data.
	* src/vte.c: use a ring buffer instead of a GArray to hold scrollback
	rows.  Fix a bug in that.  Try to preserve what the user sees when the
	scrollback size changes.
	* src/vteapp.c: set a default scrollback buffer size of 100.
2002-04-26 00:49  nalin

	* src/vte.c: Discard redundant cursor-position exposes.

2002-03-04 18:57  nalin

	* src/termcap.c, src/termcap.h, src/vte.c: Use ssize_t to measure string
	offsets in termcap, and don't assume that all capabilities have
	values.  This fixes some nasty crashes.

2002-03-04 11:53  nalin

	* src/vte.c: add a missing bounds-check in the erase-in-row
	function

2002-03-04 01:13  nalin

	* README, src/vte.c: Send the slave pty's erase character when the
	user hits backspace.

2002-03-04 00:59  nalin

	* src/vte.c: Draw cursors to fill the entire cell.  Draw the blank
	alternate character (ooh, tough).  Remove a redundant expose.

2002-03-03 23:49  nalin

	* src/trie.c: stop using wcsnlen, which is a GNU extension

2002-03-03 23:43  nalin

	* src/caps.h, src/pty.h, src/termcap.h, src/trie.h, src/vte.c,
	src/vte.h: Add support for the line-drawing characters in the special
	characters and line-drawing character set. (See
	[http://vt100.net/docs/vt102-ug/table5-13.html].)

2002-03-03 21:57  nalin

	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h, src/vte.c: Properly differentiate insertion
	delta (working screen) from scrolling delta.	Add environment setting
	to the pty code.

2002-02-27 21:54  nalin

	* src/trie.c, src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Make the Xft support use long-lived
	data items.  Clean up a lot of other Xft-related code.

2002-02-27 10:45  nalin

	* src/vte.c: actually hook up the nd handler to the "nd" sequence

2002-02-27 00:05  nalin

	* autogen.sh, configure.in, src/vte.c, src/vte.h: - Add sub-optimal
	Xft rendering (set VTE_USE_XFT to "1" to try it); still needs
	quite a bit of work to be useful.  Implement character-position-absolute
	and line-position-absolute, which I  think are the only sequences which
	emacs uses and which weren't implemented.

2002-02-25 12:43  nalin

	* src/Makefile.am: distcheck fixes

2002-02-25 12:41  nalin

	* README: add that line-drawing does not work to README

2002-02-25 12:40  nalin

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: tree fixups

2002-02-25 12:38  nalin

	* configure.in: fix autoconf reference file problem

2002-02-25 12:38  nalin

	* src/Makefile.in: remove stuff which should never have been added

2002-02-25 12:37  nalin

	* configure.ac, configure.in, src/Makefile.in: rename configure.ac
	to configure.in, remove 2.5isms

2002-02-25 12:35  nalin

	* doc/ctlseqs.ps, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure:
	remove stuff that should never have been in there
